#  What is Nuclide and Nuclide server
> Nuclide is built as a single package on top of Atom to provide hackability and the support of an active community.
It provides a first-class development environment for React Native, Hack and Flow projects.
> In addition to local development, Nuclide supports remote development. Using one of three authentication methods (Password, an SSH agent, or a private key), you can connect to a project on a remote machine. This project is then added to your Project Explorerâ€™s File Tree as a remote project where development occurs just it would with a local project.
> Nuclide has two main components, the client and the optional server. The client is set up via an Atom apm package on your local machine. The server is set up via a Node npm package on any machine where you have remote projects to which Nuclide will connect.
